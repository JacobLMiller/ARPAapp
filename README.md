**ARPA Application**

This application allows the user to fill out a quick Site Form, which it then converts to a PDF which is put into an email and sent.

*As of 5/7/2020*

Most of the in-use code can be found (when the Android option is selected in the top left of the project tab in Android Studio) at /app/java/com.android.myfirstapp/PDFactivity.

Important note, as of now the address the form is sent to is hard-coded with a fake email. You can find it on line 132 of PDFactivity to change it to a centralized location.
